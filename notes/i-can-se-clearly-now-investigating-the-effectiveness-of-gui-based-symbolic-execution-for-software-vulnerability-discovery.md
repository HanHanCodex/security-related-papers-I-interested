# I Can SE Clearly Now: Investigating the Effectiveness of GUI-based Symbolic Execution for Software Vulnerability Discovery

**研究方向：** Symbolic Execution, GUI Testing

## 📝 原文摘要 (Original Abstract)
> We investigate the effectiveness of combining Symbolic Execution (SE) with Graphical User Interface (GUI) testing for vulnerability discovery. Traditional SE struggles with complex, stateful GUI applications. This work introduces a methodology to guide symbolic execution using GUI event traces, improving path exploration and demonstrating increased success in discovering vulnerabilities in real-world GUI applications compared to traditional methods.
