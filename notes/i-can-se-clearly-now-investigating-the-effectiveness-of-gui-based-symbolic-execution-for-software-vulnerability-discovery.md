# I Can SE Clearly Now: Investigating the Effectiveness of GUI-based Symbolic Execution for Software Vulnerability Discovery

**研究方向：** Symbolic Execution, GUI Testing

## 📝 原文摘要 (Original Abstract)
> Software with complex Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) poses a significant challenge for automated vulnerability discovery. This paper explores the effectiveness of combining GUI interaction modeling with symbolic execution to efficiently explore the state space of GUI-driven applications. We introduce a novel technique to generate symbolic constraints based on user inputs and GUI events, demonstrating its capability to discover previously unknown vulnerabilities in real-world desktop applications.

## 💡 助理总结 (创新点/Insights)
> **核心洞察：将符号执行的威力拓展到**人机交互界面 (GUI)**。创新点在于提出了将 GUI 事件和用户输入转化为符号约束的机制，解决了 GUI 应用中状态空间爆炸和输入生成困难的问题。**
