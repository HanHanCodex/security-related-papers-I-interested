# Using a Hypervisor for Enforcing Control Flow Integrity in Native Compiled Programs

**研究方向：** Control Flow Integrity, Hypervisor

## 📝 原文摘要 (Original Abstract)
> This work explores novel methods for hardware-assisted Control Flow Integrity (CFI) enforcement. By leveraging the isolation and privilege of a hypervisor, it can monitor and validate the control flow transitions of guest applications with minimal performance overhead. The technique focuses on native compiled programs and addresses the challenges of preserving performance while achieving strong security guarantees.

## 💡 助理总结 (创新点/Insights)
