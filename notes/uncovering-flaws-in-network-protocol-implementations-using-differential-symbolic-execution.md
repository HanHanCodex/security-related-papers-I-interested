# Uncovering Flaws in Network Protocol Implementations Using Differential Symbolic Execution

**研究方向：** Symbolic Execution, Network Protocol

## 📝 原文摘要 (Original Abstract)
> Differential testing is a powerful technique for finding bugs in implementations of the same specification. This paper introduces Differential Symbolic Execution (DSE) to network protocol analysis. DSE executes two different implementations of a network protocol simultaneously, using their semantic differences (in constraint satisfaction) to automatically generate inputs that expose flaws where the implementations diverge from the protocol specification.
