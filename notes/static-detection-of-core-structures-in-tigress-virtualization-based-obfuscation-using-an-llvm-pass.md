# Static Detection of Core Structures in Tigress Virtualization-Based Obfuscation Using an LLVM Pass

**研究方向：** Obfuscation, Static Analysis, LLVM

## 📝 原文摘要 (Original Abstract)
> Virtualization-based obfuscation (e.g., Tigress) poses a significant challenge to automated program analysis. This paper proposes a static analysis approach, implemented as an LLVM Pass, to effectively identify and extract the core structures hidden by the virtualization layer. This method allows for targeted deobfuscation and subsequent vulnerability analysis, significantly reducing the manual effort required for reverse engineering complex obfuscated binaries.
