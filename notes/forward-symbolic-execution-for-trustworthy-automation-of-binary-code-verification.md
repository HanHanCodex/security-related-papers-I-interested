# Forward Symbolic Execution for Trustworthy Automation of Binary Code Verification

**研究方向：** Symbolic Execution, Binary Analysis

## 📝 原文摘要 (Original Abstract)
> We present a theory of forward symbolic execution for trustworthy automation of binary code verification. The theory's foundation is a set of inference rules where each member corresponds to an operation in a symbolic execution engine. We implemented the theory in the HOL4 theorem prover and instantiated it using the HolBA binary analysis library, providing machine-checked proofs of soundness of symbolic execution for BIR.
