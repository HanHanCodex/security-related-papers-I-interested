# Rethinking the capability of fine-tuned language models for automated vulnerability repair

**研究方向：** LLM Security, Vulnerability Repair

## 📝 原文摘要 (Original Abstract)
> Automated Program Repair (APR) using LLMs often suffers from generating semantically incorrect or insecure patches. This work re-evaluates the role of fine-tuned LLMs in APR. We demonstrate that current fine-tuning strategies focus too heavily on syntactic correctness. We propose a novel DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) based repair mechanism guided by security properties, showing that LLMs, when aligned to security objectives, can generate patches that are not only syntactically correct but also semantically secure.

## 💡 助理总结 (创新点/Insights)
