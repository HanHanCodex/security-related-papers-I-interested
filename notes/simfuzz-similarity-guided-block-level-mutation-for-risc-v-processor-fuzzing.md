# SimFuzz: Similarity-guided Block-level Mutation for RISC-V Processor Fuzzing

**研究方向：** Fuzzing, Hardware Security, RISC-V

## 📝 原文摘要 (Original Abstract)
> We implemented SimFuzz for the RISC-V GC instruction set and evaluated it against major open-source RISC-V processor designs. SimFuzz is able to reveal inconsistencies in Rocket, BOOM, and XiangShan, uncovering previously unknown bugs. The core innovation lies in using block-level similarity metrics to guide mutation, which is highly effective for hardware designs.
