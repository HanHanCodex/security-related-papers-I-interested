# AutoVulnPHP: LLM-Powered Two-Stage PHP Vulnerability Detection and Automated Localization

**研究方向：** LLM Security, Vulnerability Detection

## 📝 原文摘要 (Original Abstract)
> We propose AutoVulnPHP, a novel LLM-powered two-stage framework for detecting and localizing vulnerabilities in PHP code. The first stage uses a customized LLM to detect the presence of a vulnerability type, and the second stage uses an Incremental Sequence Analysis and Localization (ISAL) module for precise localization. On public benchmarks and PHPVD, AutoVulnPHP achieves 99.7% detection accuracy, 99.5% F1 score, and 81.0% localization rate. Deployed on real-world repositories, it discovered 429 previously unknown vulnerabilities.
